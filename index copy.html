                <h3>Personal Project 1: CoronaCertify</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I developed a Django project to provide a streamlined solution for issuing COVID-19 positive or negative certificates to users. This project represents a crucial step in facilitating safer interactions and curbing the spread of the virus within communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The project's framework comprises a meticulously crafted multi-step process starting with user registration. To fortify security measures and safeguard against potential threats, the registration process integrates Google reCAPTCHA, ensuring only authentic users can proceed. Following registration, users undergo email OTP verification, crucial in validating their email addresses and establishing secure communication channels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Once verified, users gain access to their personalized dashboard to input their home details. This information is vital for tracking and managing potential COVID-19 exposure, empowering authorities to respond swiftly to emerging cases. To bolster security, users undergo another round of email OTP verification before accessing their home section, guaranteeing authorized access and safeguarding sensitive health-related information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Within their home section, users declare their COVID-19 test results, specifying positive or negative outcomes. Administrators meticulously review these declarations, verifying their authenticity. Upon approval, users can download their COVID-19 certificates in PDF format, providing tangible proof of their health status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The project leverages FastAPI and PostgreSQL for efficient backend operations, facilitating rapid data processing and retrieval. Deployed on an EC2 instance, the project ensures high availability and scalability to accommodate growing user demand, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing overall performance.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                    In conclusion, this Django project offers a holistic approach to COVID-19 management, combining stringent security measures, efficient data processing, and user-centric features. By streamlining certificate issuance, it significantly contributes to efforts aimed at safeguarding public health and promoting safer interactions within society.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I've developed a Django web application for live chat functionality with PostgreSQL integration. This project aims to facilitate real-time communication and networking between users, enhancing their overall experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The application begins with user registration, where individuals can sign up by providing their name, email, and password. Once registered, users can log in using their credentials, gaining access to the platform's features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Upon logging in, users are presented with suggestions for potential connections, generated randomly. This feature aims to broaden users' networks and encourage interaction within the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Users have the option to send follow requests to other users, expressing their interest in establishing a connection. Once the recipient accepts the request, the two users become friends within the platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Once connected as friends, users can initiate conversations through the messaging section. This feature enables real-time chat between friends, fostering meaningful interactions and communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Additionally, users have the capability to exchange pictures within the messaging interface, further enhancing the communication experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To personalize their profiles, users can update their individual bios and profile pictures, allowing them to express themselves and provide additional context to their connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The application is equipped with robust error handling, ensuring that if invalid URLs are entered, Django defaults to a custom 404 page, enhancing the user experience.
                    </p>
